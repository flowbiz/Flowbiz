# 1. <a id="features">Features</a>
## 1.1. <a id="screen_mode">Screen Mode</a>
The Flowbiz landing page should be adjusted for both Desktop and Mobile views<br>
The Mobile view can be seen here: https://xd.adobe.com/view/c55a60fd-612a-4226-b33e-4f770f0c510a-9009/screen/802d8e3d-acfc-4359-b925-8b15913f4fdd ????? 
- For each page and functionality, the designer should present both modes: Desktop and Mobile
## 1.2. <a id="home_page_info_cards">Home Page Info Cards</a>
There are 4 Info Cards in the home page:<br>
1. Create & Develop Your Product<br>
2. Which one are you?<br>
3. Weâ€™ve got you covered<br>
4. How Does It Work

The cards should be presented according to the design specification
- The design specification defines 2 modes: Desktop and Mobile.<br>
The work should cover both modes.
### 1.2.1. <a id="data_source_topic">Data Source</a>
All the data in the Home cards is coming from external API.<br>
In gatsby building process it calls for get-blogs api and on response<br>
it uses the **gatsby** createNode api to create the different gatsby nodes that are needed for the site rendering.<br>
The React CardBody component receives a single card data information and renders the card visual view
### 1.2.2. <a id="card_structure_topic">Card Structure</a>
A UX Card may contain the following:
1. name - Name of the card. Usually used to render the card header text
2. headers - Optional headers list to be displayed in the card
3. description - Descriptive text to be displayed in the card. May contain also an image
4. buttons - A list of button info items that should be rendered to buttons in the card
5. style - The style card sub field is responsible to set the styling of the card<br>
It contains a motive sub field that determines the general

For example, the following card input :
```
{
  "name": "Create & Develop Your Product",
  "headers": [
    "EASY AS 1,2,3"
  ],
  "description": {
    "text": "Answer a few simple questions and let the WonderFlow wizard help you bring your app and software visions to life.",
    "image": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12394551/163946957-fb473e0d-9aa6-4100-a980-15dade961213.png",
  "buttons": [
    {
      "type": "Action",
      "method": "goToWizard",
      "label": "Try the Wonderflow Wizard",
    },
    {
      "type": "Action",
      "method": "learnMore",
      "label": "Learn more",
    }
  ],
  "style": {
    "motive": "white_card",
    "button_1": "light_blue_button"
  }
}
```

should produce this Card Visual:

The developer should modify the React components and CSS styles in order to achieve the desired card UX style.<br>
The developer may also modify the data source by adding more card fields and values
- Specific CSS styling attributes should be configured in the relevant css part of the gatsby application
- The Card info data should only contain style keywords (motive, layout, etc.) but not specific css coding
